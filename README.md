# Text-File-Analyzer
Developed an AI-powered text analyzer using Google Gemini AI, spaCy, and YAKE to perform text summarization, sentiment analysis, keyword extraction, and named entity recognition. Built an interactive interface with Gradio, enabling users to analyze text or uploaded .txt files, enhancing my skills in NLP, AI integration, and data processing.
